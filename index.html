                                                        <p>The NYC subway system faces significant overcrowding during peak hours, especially on certain lines and stations. This can lead to delays, discomfort for passengers, and safety concerns. While other large systems like Tokyo's are also heavily used, they often have more frequent trains and better crowd management strategies.</p>
